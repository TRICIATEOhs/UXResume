                            Due to Covid-19, all Usability Testing sessions were all conducted via UXArmy, an online web tool that records the session. As UXArmy doesn’t allow for facilitation of the session, we decided to make use of Google Hangout as our primary communication tool while participants share their screens with us and perform the tasks via UXArmy. With that, we were able to capture the session (both video and audio), listen to verbal cues, and inquire about participant behaviors.

                        <p>Participants aged between their 20s and 40s actively seek information, whereas those in their 50s and 60s prefer information to be straightforward and obvious.</p>

                        <p>However, the older participants were hesitant to explore, fearing they might make mistakes or be unable to undo them. Therefore, my updated design aims to alleviate cognitive burden on users.</p>
