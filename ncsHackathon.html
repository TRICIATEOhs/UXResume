                            The NCS Hackathon 2020 aimed to harness employees' creativity and problem-solving abilities to address challenges encountered by clients or the organization amidst or following the COVID-19 pandemic.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            I've long desired to participate in a hackathon but faced obstacles due to the absence of team members willing to take on the challenge. Nevertheless, recognizing its potential value, I successfully enlisted a group of colleagues who shared my enthusiasm.

                            Initially, we needed to identify existing problems suitable for a hackathon-style resolution. While we entertained several ideas, our final decision was to address an issue directly affecting NCS employees.

                            Amidst the challenges posed by COVID-19, NCS is striving to swiftly distribute information to employees while also gathering as much pertinent information as possible. As employees ourselves, we sometimes find ourselves inundated with the volume of information that needs to be processed.

                                        How can we enable NCS Staff to execute the required COVID-19 measures in a manner that is more efficient (retaining information and achieving the same outcome with less effort) and organized?

                                        A comprehensive mobile application for crisis management (focused on contagious diseases) tailored for NCS Employees to facilitate the execution of necessary measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                            I recognize that while the solution may not be revolutionary, time is of the essence. This idea seems the most feasible for quick implementation, enabling employees to use it promptly once deployed. Therefore, the team opted to proceed with this approach.</p>

                            During the ideation phase, we engaged in creating user stories and crafting paper prototypes to conceptualize the application's appearance. Utilizing the user stories enabled us to prioritize the essential features crucial for making our solution valuable.

                        <p>
                            We additionally created a moodboard to select the color scheme for our mobile application. Our primary inspiration stemmed from the colors in NEXUS (displayed in the top left-hand corner of the image below). However, we found these colors to be too vibrant and cheerful, which did not align with the tone we wanted for our crisis management application.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            We aimed to avoid a dull and uninspiring appearance for our application. Therefore, we toned down the colors, transforming them into pastel shades. This adjustment resulted in a softer aesthetic that remains visually appealing.

Additionally, we meticulously design corresponding screens, ensuring that each interface element aligns seamlessly with the user experience we envision.
