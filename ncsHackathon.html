                        NCS Hackathon 2020 is a hackathon that wants employees to unleash their creativity and problem solving skills to solve challenges faced by clients or the Organisation 'through COVID-19' or 'post COVID-19'.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have always wanted to be a part of a hackathon but couldn't participate in it due to lack of team members who are willing to brave the storm. However, I know that it would be a good experience for me and managed to rope in a group of colleagues who are as eager as I am.
                    </p>

                        <h4 class="grad">Discover and Reframe</h4>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        First, we had to think of existing problems that could use a solution (that’s good enough for a hackathon). We had a few ideas on the table, but ultimately we decided to work on an issue faced by NCS employees.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Due to COVID-19, NCS is scrambling together ways to disseminate information quickly to employees while trying to obtain as much information as they can. As employees, sometimes we will feel overwhelmed with the amount of information required to be processed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Here’s what we are talking about:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Subscribing to 3 NCS WhatsApp chats to get updated information on COVID-19 regulations</li>
                            <li>Being spammed via emails as well to the chain of command on who we should contact if we are feeling unwell - there are Reporting Officers, Health Managers, Floor ICs, Higher Management, etc</li>
                            <li>Receiving contact tracing form, temperature taking form, travel declaration form, raise a request to return to office form all in various formats!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <div class="card card-pink">

                            <p>
                                How might we allow NCS Staff to perform the necessary measures needed to be taken for COVID-19 in a more effective (retaining information and achieving the same outcome with less effort) and organised manner?
                            </p>

                                A one-stop crisis management (for contagious diseases) mobile application for NCS Employees to perform necessary measures needed to be taken during COVID-19.

                    <p>
                        For ideation, it involved us creating user stories and paper prototyping to visualize how the application should look like. With the user stories, it allowed us to prioritise the more important features necessary to make our solution valuable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We also did a moodboard to decide on the colour scheme we wanted for our mobile application. Our main inspiration came from the colours in NEXUS (on the top left hand corner of the image below). However, those colour are too bright and cheerful which was not fitting for our crisis management application. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We did not want our application to look dull and mundane, hence we referenced the colours, tone it down and made it into pastel shades which gave a much softer look - yet still pleasing to the eyes.
                    </p>

                        Due to the fact that we were all working from home, we made it a point to have a team call via Microsoft Teams after every agile phase so that we can showcase what we have done, answer any questions or inform each other on any findings we may have.

                        Due to time constraints and limited participant resources, we decided to test with 4 NCS employees and observed if they had any issues trying to complete the tasks.

                        The video shown below is a short clip on how we conducted the Usability Testing. We provided our participants with the link to our clickable prototype, provided them with user tasks and communicated via Microsoft Teams.
