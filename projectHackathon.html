                NCS Hackathon 2020 is a hackathon that wants employees to unleash their creativity and problem solving skills to solve challenges faced by clients or the Organisation 'through COVID-19' or 'post COVID-19'.
              </p>

              <p>
                I have always wanted to be a part of a hackathon but couldn't participate in it due to lack of team members who are willing to brave the storm. However, I know that it would be a good experience for me and managed to rope in a group of colleagues who are as eager as I am.

              <p class="add-bg-colour">
                <b>DISCOVER</b>
              </p>

              <p>
                First, we had to think of existing problems that could use a solution (that's good enough for a hackathon). We had a few ideas on the table, but ultimately we decided to work on an issue faced by NCS employees.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to COVID-19, NCS is scrambling together ways to disseminate information quickly to employees while trying to obtain as much information as they can. As employees, sometimes we will feel overwhelmed with the amount of information required to be processed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's what we are talking about:
                <p>
                  <img src="images/hackathon_images/hackathon_problem.png" class="card-img-top" alt="hackathon problem">
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Subscribing to NCS's WhatsApp chat to get information on COVID-19</li>
                  <li>Our very own Department WhatsApp chat that disseminates similar information</li>
                  <li>Our very own Team WhatsApp chat that sends similar information (or forwarded information from the above 2 channels</li>
                  <li>Lots of chats and emails on the chain of command like who we should contact if we are feeling unwell and what we should do next. For example, Staff to report to Reporting Officers as well as Health Managers. Health Managers to report to Floor ICs who will then report to the higher management, who will report to other higher management (you get my point...)</li>
                  <li>We are also sent contact tracing forms (in excel), temperature taking forms (in excel), travel declaration form (in email), raise a request to return to office (in email) and the list goes on.</li>
                </ul>

                It is so difficult to search for information as we can not remember where we received it from.
              </p>




              <p class="add-bg-colour">
                <b>REFRAME</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Our Problem:</b> How might we allow NCS Staff to perform the necessary measures needed to be taken for COVID-19 in a more effective (retaining information and achieving the same outcome with less effort) and organised manner?
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Our Solution:</b> A one-stop crisis management (for contagious diseases) mobile application for NCS Employees to perform necessary measures needed to be taken during COVID-19.
              </p>



              <p class="add-bg-colour">
                <b>IDEATE</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                For ideation, it involved us creating user stories and paper prototyping to visualize how the application should look like. With the user stories, it allowed us to prioritise the more important features necessary to make our solution valuable.
              </p>

              </div>

              <p>
                We also did a moodboard to decide on the colour scheme we wanted for our mobile application. Our main inspiration came from the colours in NEXUS (on the top left hand corner of the image below). However, those colour are too bright and cheerful which was not fitting for our crisis management application. We did not want our application to look dull and mundane, hence we referenced the colours, tone it down and made it into pastel shades which gave a much softer look - yet still pleasing to the eyes.

              <p class="add-bg-colour">
                <b>VISUALISE</b>
              </p>

              <p>
                Due to the fact that we were all working from home, we made it a point to have a team call via Microsoft Teams after every agile phase so that we can showcase what we have done, answer any questions or inform each other on any findings we may have.
              </p>

              <p>
                The video shown below is an example of how we communicated with each other.
              </p>

              <p class="add-bg-colour">
                <b>EVALUTE</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                After we have linked our screens into clickable prototype, we tested with 4 participants (who are our colleagues) and observed if they had any issues trying to complete the tasks.
              </p>

              <p>
                The video shown below is a short clip on how we conducted the Usability Testing. We provided our participants with the link to our clickable prototype and utilised Microsoft Teams to observe their behaviour. 
              </p>

              </p>

              <p>
                The general feedback provided by our participants is that the user interface is clean and it was easy to perform the tasks given. However, there were some flows that we had to streamline a little more.

                  <li><b>Pending Tasks:</b> By introducing the pending tasks, we aim to reduce users' mental load on the list of things they are required to perform before they are being release back home.</li>
                  <li><b>Mobile Usage:</b> Marking attendance and acknowledge medical supplies are currently in the form of a printed sheet. Staff are required pass the papers around and sign on it. However, if we are talking about contagious disease, we want to minimize contact with other colleagues as much as possible. Hence, a mobile application.</li>
                  <li><b>Easy Contact Tracing:</b> After looking at the Contact Tracing Excelsheet, we realised that users have to manually enter the name of the colleague, email address and phone number. To make things easier, we will display a list of "Recent NCS contacts" or perhaps a list of colleagues from the same department, so that users can easily add contacts with just a few taps. </li>

                Overall, it was a very good experience and I enjoyed it very much. Although time was a constraint due to the fact that all of us had full-time projects during office hours, we only had after-work, weekends and public holidays to work on the Hackathon. I am thankful for my teammates who were very proactive throughout and working with them was so much fun.
