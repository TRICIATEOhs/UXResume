                            The client representing Eubiq expressed a need to overhaul their website for Eubiq Singapore. They aimed to optimize the purchasing process, as they perceived a stagnation in sales or a lack of sufficient sales growth over a period. I had the privilege to freelance on this project as a designer, providing my expertise and services to fulfill their requirements and enhance their online platform.

                                    <h5>The conundrum</h5>
                                    <p>• Our dilemma lies in the necessity to utilise <b>Shopify templates</b>, restricting our ability to creatively design and confining us to the predefined elements provided by the platform</p>
                                    <p>• Eubiq lacks a sufficient quantity of high-quality images as well as information, posing challenges in effectively showcasing their products</p>

                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>We have communicated these constraints to the client, and they understood the challenges we've encounted. Additionally, we have informed them that redesigning the website is just one aspect of the process to encourage users to purchase the product. Marketing efforts are crucial, particularly given the appeal of their majoy competitor's (Line8) product offerings, which may seem more enticing than Eubiq's. </p>

                        <p>Among the few friends who have purchased or plan to purchase power tracks, the perception of Eubiq is that it's <b>expensive and offers limited products</b>, despite being one of the pioneers in Singapore.</p>

                            <p>Customers who bought bundles also bought additional accessories. It's noteworthy that the <b>majority of these customers opted for USB fast-chargers</b> in addition to the adaptors included in the bundle deals.</p>
                            <p>Continuing this pattern, <b>international plugs were also in demand</b>, indicating that although the standard adaptor is adequate, certain customers opt to include international adaptors for products purchased from abroad.</p>

                            <p>Although not common, customers who chose bundle deals also bought additional adaptors. This indicates that the number of adaptors included in the deal <b>may not suffice</b>, particularly for those purchasing the 1000mm track.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, it has been noticed that customers purchasing extra adaptors (with or without bundle) tend to acquire them in even quantities (e.g. 2, 4, 6, 8).</p>

                            <p>Additionally, there's a group of customers who’d rather <b>purchase a combination of standard adaptors and accessories</b>, such as USB and international plugs.</p>
                            <p>Lastly, there are customers who prefer to <b>buy standard adaptors in bulk</b>, making it more convenient for them to purchase adaptors individually rather than as add-ons on top of bundle deals.</p>

                                    since bundle deals appear to be highly appealing due to the convenience they offer customers, I suggested to clients that we explore the possibility of creating additional bundle deals. </p>

                                While we're utilizing a Shopify theme, crafting our own sections is necessary to assemble the information cohesively. Simply using the template as-is isn't sufficient for our needs.
